# Web Scraping - We Work Remotely Job Listings

This project demonstrates how to scrape job listings from the [We Work Remotely](https://weworkremotely.com/) website. The notebook `WebScraping.ipynb` extracts job listings, including **company name**, **position**, and the **job link**, and saves them into a CSV file for further analysis.

## Requirements

To run the notebook successfully, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `requests` - For sending HTTP requests to fetch webpage content.
- `beautifulsoup4` - For parsing HTML content and extracting relevant data.
- `pandas` - For organizing and saving the scraped data into a CSV file.
